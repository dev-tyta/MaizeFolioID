**MaizeFolioID**

---

### **1. Introduction**

**MaizeFolioID** is an image classification model crafted to predict the presence of foliar diseases in maize leaves. Leveraging the power of pre-trained models on ImageNet, it identifies specific classes of the maize leaf, aiding in early detection and potentially saving crops from devastating losses.

### **2. Getting Started**

#### **Prerequisites**

- Knowledge of deep learning and familiarity with pre-trained models.
- Python programming environment.

#### **Dependencies**
The project primarily relies on ImageNet pre-trained models. Ensure you have all necessary libraries and dependencies installed.

### **3. Data Description**

The dataset fueling this endeavor was sourced from Kaggle, shedding light on maize leaf conditions.

- **Dataset Link**: [Corn or Maize Leaf Disease Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/smaranjitghose/corn-or-maize-leaf-disease-dataset)

The dataset is structured with images representing various foliar diseases in maize leaves. Make sure to explore the dataset for a comprehensive understanding.

### **4. Model Description**

MaizeFolioID utilizes an ImageNet pre-trained model, fine-tuned to classify specific maize leaf conditions. We've made meticulous modifications to cater to our classification needs, ensuring the model's sensitivity towards the intricacies of maize leaf diseases.

### **5. Training and Evaluation**

While the model is pre-trained on ImageNet, it has been further trained on the provided dataset for specialized recognition. The evaluation metrics and results will be updated after subsequent retraining sessions, potentially featuring model performance visualizations.

### **6. Usage**

To experience the model in action:

1. Visit the Streamlit deployment: [MaizeFolioID Streamlit App](https://maizefolioid-h.streamlit.app/)
2. Alternatively, access the saved model via [Huggingface Model Hub](https://huggingface.co/Testys/MaizeFolioID).

### **7. Contribution Guidelines**
